# FlappyBirdUnity

In order to learn Unity game development, I am making a simple 2D side scroller based on the classic mobile game FlappyBird.

I started off following a tutorial from GameMakers ToolKit, using this project as a base. I have since refactored my code base and started adding in the following features myself:
- Game over detection
- TextMeshPro assets
- AudioManager to play sound effects
- Clouds using the particle system

ToDo:
- Animated sprite
- Increase speed with score
- Randomise space between pipes
- Title screen
- HighScore tracking
